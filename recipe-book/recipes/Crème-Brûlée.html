        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Vanilla Crème Brûlée is a classic French dessert known for its rich and creamy texture and a delightful contrast of flavors and textures. This decadent dessert consists of a custard base made with cream, egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla bean or extract. The mixture is gently baked in a water bath until it sets into a silky-smooth custard. Once chilled, the dessert is crowned with a thin layer of sugar, which is caramelized to create a crispy, sweet topping using a kitchen torch or broiler. The result is a dessert that is both indulgent and sophisticated, with the crack of the caramelized sugar providing a satisfying contrast to the creamy custard underneath.</p>

The vanilla-infused custard offers a delicate and comforting flavor, while the caramelized sugar crust adds a delightful crunch and sweetness. It's a dessert that encapsulates the essence of indulgence and sophistication, making it a timeless classic enjoyed by dessert enthusiasts around the world. 		</p>

            <li>2 cups heavy or light cream (or half-and-half)</li>
            <li>1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>

        <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 325 degrees. In a saucepan, combine cream, vanilla bean, and salt; cook over low heat just until hot. Let sit for a few minutes, then discard vanilla bean. (If using vanilla extract, add it now.)</li>
            <li>In a bowl, beat yolks and sugar together until light. Stir about a quarter of the vanilla cream into this mixture, then pour sugar-egg mixture into cream and stir. Pour into four 6-ounce ramekins and place ramekins in a baking dish; fill dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the ramekins.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until centers are barely set. Cool completely. Refrigerate for several hours and up to a couple of days.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, top each custard with about a teaspoon of sugar in a thin layer. Place ramekins in a broiler 2 to 3 inches from the heat source. Turn on the broiler. Cook until sugar melts and browns or even blackens a bit, about 5 minutes. Serve within 2 hours.</li>
